# Issues

- The whole screen shakes when there is a 'boom'. The effects should be limited to the view portal. While working this issue, please look for other effects that are being applied to the whole screen rather than the view portal.

- The Controls arrows should face up when the panel is minimized.

- I don't see a way to turn off the confetti.

- Fireworks go off randomly while just idling.

- The backgrounds (other than Night Sky) are horrible! We want a backlit sillohete of each of these, not cheezy photos pulled from the internet! We should be able to generate these ourselves as they are just lines and shading with some effects.

Let us start there.
