Your **PLAN.md** is ready.

👉 **[Download PLAN.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/PLAN.md)**

This document:

- Clearly captures the **vision** behind Pyrotechnica
- Documents the **evolutionary stages** from prototype to current simulator
- Assesses the **current state** (strengths and limitations)
- Lays out a **phased, task-oriented roadmap** to take the project to the next level
- Defines guiding principles and a concrete **long-term “definition of done”**

It’s written to work equally well as:

- A team alignment document
- A contributor onboarding guide
- A living roadmap you can update as milestones are completed

If you’d like, next we can:

- Break one phase (e.g. Timeline UX or Backgrounds) into **issue-sized tasks**
- Add a **technical architecture section** (engine, UI, data formats)
- Or convert this into **GitHub Issues / Milestones** format automatically
