# BOFH Resume Review 🔥

*Cracks knuckles and adjusts monitor to "judgmental angle"*

## Initial Assessment

Alright, let's see what we have here... *scrolls* ...25 years of experience? So you've been in the trenches long enough to know better than to come to ME for feedback.

---

## The Good (Yes, Even I Can Acknowledge Competence)

**1. You Understand Pain**
You've worked with WinRunner, LoadRunner, TestDirector, QTP, and the Mercury suite. You've SUFFERED. This tells me you've been through the fire and came out the other side. Anyone who survived Mercury Interactive deserves a modicum of respect.

**2. You've Actually Automated Things**
Most "QA Engineers" I've met think automation means scheduling an email to remind them to run tests manually. You've built actual frameworks. Multiple times. In different languages. Fine. I'll admit you're not a complete luser.

**3. Y2K Veteran**
You worked at the Census Bureau during Y2K? *Actually leans back with grudging respect* You've seen the end times. You've stared into the abyss of legacy code and two-digit year formats. The thousand-yard stare is real.

**4. Government Experience**
Census Bureau, Fannie Mae, FINRA... You've navigated bureaucracy that would make Kafka weep. This means you can probably survive ANY corporate environment.

## The Problems (And There Are ALWAYS Problems)

**1. That URL**
```
Personal Website: http://billclaytor.com/
```

HTTP?! IN 2025?! *slams desk* Do you want to get MITM'd? Do you WANT recruiters to see that little "Not Secure" badge in their browser? Fix it. Now. Or I'm adding you to the "special" email routing rules.

**2. "Planed"**
> "Planed the QA Automation team schedule..."

It's "PLANNED." With two N's. You've been testing software for 25 years and you let a TYPO through? In your OWN resume? *shakes head* The irony is not lost on me. I've terminated accounts for less.

**3. That Summary**
> "I am a Senior Software Engineer with 25 years..."

*dramatic eye roll* 

"I am..." - you sound like a LinkedIn bot. Everyone's summary starts this way. You know what would be better?

"Battle-hardened QA veteran with 25 years of breaking software and the developers who wrote it."

THAT would make me keep reading. Instead of reaching for my "automatic deletion" script.

**4. The Career Break Framing**
> "I decided to take a break to recharge, refocus..."

*taps fingers impatiently*

You deployed Rails apps to Dokku, built test frameworks in THREE competing technologies, and did coding challenges. That's not "taking a break" - that's what the rest of us call "working." Frame it better or management types will think you were literally on a beach somewhere.

**5. Skills Section: The Novel**
Your skills list is longer than my ticket queue on a Monday morning. And that's saying something. 

You've got "QA/QC" AND "Quality assurance" AND "Software quality assurance" listed separately. You know what that tells me? You padded the list for ATS systems. *I* know it. YOU know it. 

Pick your top 15 and delete the rest. I delete things all the time. It's therapeutic.

## Red Flags That Would Concern A Lesser Admin

| Issue | My Take |
|-------|---------|
| No completed degree | Who cares? Neither does Linus Torvalds. |
| Career break | You used it productively. Move on. |
| Multiple short stints | Government contracts. Everyone knows. |
| Lots of different tools | That's called "adaptability," lusers. |

## The BOFH Verdict

*Leans back, strokes chin*

Look. I've seen a LOT of resumes. Most go straight to null. Accidentally. *cough*

This one? It's... *grimaces* ...competent. You've clearly been around. You've automated things. You've managed people (my condolences). You've survived technologies that no longer exist.

But here's the thing: **Your resume reads like documentation.**

And not the good kind. Not the "man pages" that tell you exactly what you need. It reads like those 500-page enterprise manuals that nobody ever opens.

You need:
1. **Impact metrics** - How many bugs did you find? How much time did you save? What would have BROKEN without you?
2. **War stories** - Not literally, but achievements that make people go "wow"
3. **Personality** - This is YOUR resume. Make it sound like YOU, not a requirements document.

## Would I Hire You?

*Long pause*

...Yes.

But only because you survived Mercury Interactive tools AND government bureaucracy. That combination suggests you can handle literally anything. Including me.

Plus, anyone with 25 years of experience knows not to ask me stupid questions. And that alone makes you more qualified than 90% of the lusers I deal with daily.

**Rating: 7.5/10** - Would reluctantly add to the "approved" user list.

*Returns to network monitoring*

*Notices someone's downloading suspicious attachments*

*Grins*

Now if you'll excuse me, I have... "maintenance" to perform.

🔥 `sudo rm -rf /home/luser/*` 🔥

*The BOFH has spoken. Your resume has been... acknowledged. Don't make me regret it.*
