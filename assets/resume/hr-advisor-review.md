### Areas for Improvement

**1. Summary Statement**
The current summary is generic. Consider making it more compelling:
- Add quantifiable achievements (e.g., "reduced regression testing time by 60%")
- Mention specific value delivered to employers

**2. Career Break Framing**
While the Professional Development section is honest and shows initiative, consider:
- Leading with the skills gained rather than "decided to take a break"
- Highlighting the tangible outputs (applications deployed, frameworks evaluated)

**3. Education Section**
The education history is fragmented across three institutions without a completed degree explicitly stated. Consider:
- Consolidating into a single entry or clarifying the narrative
- Emphasizing professional certifications more prominently

**4. Quantifiable Achievements**
Many bullet points describe responsibilities rather than accomplishments. Add metrics where possible:
- Test coverage percentages
- Defects found/prevented
- Time/cost savings
- Team size managed

**5. Skills Section Organization**
The skills list is comprehensive but lengthy. Consider:
- Highlighting top/most relevant skills
- Grouping by proficiency level (expert, proficient, familiar)
- Removing redundant entries (e.g., "QA/QC" and "Quality assurance" overlap)

**6. URL Consistency**
Personal website uses `http://` - should be `https://` for professionalism.

### Red Flags (Minor)

- **Typo**: "Planed" should be "Planned" in the APUS section
- **Repetitive language**: Several job descriptions use similar phrasing
- **Date gap**: None significant, career break is explained

---

### Recommendations

1. **Tailor for specific roles** - This appears to be a comprehensive CV; create targeted versions for specific job applications

2. **Add certifications section** - Mentioned "Certified in Java and .NET" but no dedicated certifications section

3. **Modernize format** - Consider a more visual layout for digital viewing while maintaining ATS compatibility

4. **Include a "Key Achievements" section** - Highlight 3-5 career-defining accomplishments at the top
