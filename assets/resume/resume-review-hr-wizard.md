wclaytor: We are working on an update to the client resume! We have added their two most recent engagements to their existing markdown file by copy/pasting them from LinkedIn but they don't quite fit the template and will likely break our display system. Please review the two most recent entries and update the formatting to be consistent with the template and how it is used in the rest of the resume.

GitHub Copilot: I'll review the two most recent work experience entries in the resume and update them to match the template format and the rest of the resume's structure. 

Read [](file:///workspaces/wclaytor.github.io/assets/resume/resume-wclaytor.md#1-1), lines 1 to 80

Now I can see the issues with the two most recent entries. Let me update them to match the template format: 

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```


Read [](file:///workspaces/wclaytor.github.io/assets/resume/resume-wclaytor.md#32-32), lines 32 to 72

Perfect! I've successfully updated the two most recent work experience entries in the resume. Here's what I fixed:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Senior Automation QA Engineer** (insightsoftware)
- ✅ Removed duplicate title lines and LinkedIn formatting artifacts
- ✅ Properly formatted company name in bold
- ✅ Added location (Remote)
- ✅ Fixed date format to match template: `05/2023 – Present`
- ✅ Added company description
- ✅ Maintained proper bullet point formatting

### 2. **Professional Development** (Career Break)
- ✅ Restructured to match template format
- ✅ Changed "Career Break" to be the company field in bold
- ✅ Fixed date format: `08/2022 – 03/2023`
- ✅ Removed LinkedIn duration artifacts ("8 mos")
- ✅ Added horizontal rule separator (`---`) between entries
- ✅ Maintained proper paragraph and bullet structure

Both entries now follow the same pattern as the rest of the resume with consistent formatting for company names, dates, locations, and structure. This should work perfectly with your display system!

Made changes.

wclaytor: All right, all right! What do you think of the 2025 revision of the client resume?

GitHub Copilot: Let me take a look at the HTML version of the resume to see how it rendered! Let me review the HTML file content I can see from the attachment. The 2025 revision looks **excellent**! Here's my assessment:

## HR Wizard's Resume Review 📋✨

*Adjusts spectacles and reviews the document carefully...*

### First Impressions
This is a **strong, senior-level technical resume** that clearly communicates depth of experience. The candidate presents as a seasoned QA/Automation professional with genuine expertise spanning multiple decades.

### Strengths 💪

1. **Clear Career Progression** - Shows growth from Test Automation Specialist → Lead QA → Manager → Senior Engineer roles. This trajectory demonstrates both technical depth and leadership capability.

2. **Quantifiable Experience** - Skills section with years of experience is helpful for quick screening. The "10+ years" markers immediately signal veteran status.

3. **Diverse Industry Experience** - Government (Census Bureau), Financial Services (FINRA, Fannie Mae), Media (NPR), Tech (Puppet), Healthcare - this breadth is valuable.

4. **Technical Credibility** - Deep knowledge of automation frameworks across eras (WinRunner → Selenium → Nightwatch → Playwright). Shows adaptability and continuous learning.

5. **The Career Break** - Handled professionally! Showing productive use of time (learning, building projects) turns a potential red flag into a positive.

### Areas for Consideration 🤔

1. **Summary Could Be Stronger** - "I am a Senior Software Engineer..." is passive. Consider leading with impact: *"Senior Software Engineer with 25 years driving quality excellence through test automation, team leadership, and process improvement."*

2. **Impact Metrics Missing** - Bullet points are task-focused. Where possible, add outcomes:
   - "Reduced regression testing time by X%"
   - "Increased test coverage from X% to Y%"
   - "Led team of X engineers"

3. **Current Role Light on Details** - The insightsoftware position lists responsibilities but fewer concrete accomplishments. What has been *achieved* since May 2023?

4. **Skills Section Length** - Very comprehensive, perhaps too much. Consider consolidating or highlighting top 10-15 most relevant skills for target roles.

5. **Education Section** - Three schools listed without degrees completed. Consider simplifying to "Coursework in English" or omitting if it doesn't add value for target roles.

6. **Links Section** - The personal website URL uses HTTP, not HTTPS. Small detail, but for a technical professional, this matters.

### Target Role Fit Assessment 🎯

| Role Type | Fit Score |
|-----------|-----------|
| Senior QA Engineer | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| QA Manager/Lead | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| SDET/Automation Architect | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Engineering Manager | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| DevOps Engineer | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Final Verdict 🏆

**Hire Confidence: HIGH**

This candidate would be an asset to any QA organization. The combination of hands-on technical skills, leadership experience, and longevity in the field is increasingly rare. 

The resume effectively tells the story of someone who has grown with the industry, adapted to new technologies, and contributed at every level from individual contributor to manager.

*The HR Wizard stamps the resume with approval* ✅
