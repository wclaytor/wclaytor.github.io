### Core Philosophy & Principles

Based on the principles Steve Krug outlines (especially in *Don’t Make Me Think*) — and as summarized in the UXPlanet article — these capture his core beliefs and design philosophy:

* **Make it simple, obvious, and intuitive** — the golden rule: users should not have to “think” to figure out what to do. Each question mark or moment of hesitation undermines usability. ([UX Planet][4])
* **Design for how people actually behave** — people don’t read pages carefully; they scan. People often choose the first “reasonable” option (satisficing) rather than the optimal one; and they will “muddle through” rather than strive for perfection. ([Medium][5])
* **Prioritize clarity over cleverness** — avoid marketing jargon, clever-but-confusing text, or unnecessary complexity. Use plain, obvious language and clear visual cues so that clickable items and navigation are obvious. ([Readingraphics][6])
* **Omit needless words** — eliminate extraneous content. Krug’s famous rule: “Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left.” This helps reduce distractions, makes content easier to scan, and keeps the interface focused. ([Goodreads][7])
* **Self-evident or self-explanatory design** — if something can’t be made self-evident, at least make it self-explanatory: minimal instructions, minimal cognitive load. ([The Rabbit Hole][8])
* **Consistent, intuitive navigation & structure** — navigation should help users find what they want easily, know where they are, and understand what’s possible next. Logical structure, consistent layout, and conventional patterns are important. ([Readingraphics][6])
* **Respect users’ time and intelligence** — build goodwill by being considerate: don’t make users waste time or think too hard. Usability is not just functionality — it's courtesy. ([HowToes][9])
* **Test early and often — usability testing is critical** — subjective debate among designers or stakeholders is no substitute for observing real users. Testing helps expose issues that design teams may overlook. ([sensible.com][3])
* **There are no universal “right” answers — context matters** — good design is rarely about following rigid rules, but about using guiding principles thoughtfully based on user needs, context, and goals. ([ddsn.com][10])

### Memorable Quotes / "Wisdom Bits"

From his writings and those collated in the UXPlanet article: ([UX Planet][4])

* *“Don’t make me think.”* — the central principle of usability. ([main--heymichellemac.netlify.app][11])
* *“Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left.”* — advocating drastic simplification of content. ([Goodreads][7])
* *“If something requires a large investment of time — or looks like it will — it’s less likely to be used.”* ([UX Planet][4])
* *“Making every page or screen self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better.”* — self-evidence in design improves usability and comfort. ([UX Planet][4])
* *“Usability is about people and how they understand and use things, not about technology.”* — focus on human behaviors rather than fancy tech. ([SoBrief][12])
* *“The reality is there are no simple ‘right’ answers for most web-design questions … The real answer … is ‘It depends.’”* — acknowledging trade-offs and nuance in design. ([sensible.com][3])

### What Steve Krug Offers / What He’s Known For

* **Accessible UX for non-specialists**: *Don’t Make Me Think* was written to be short, digestible, and compelling even for people without formal UX training — executives, product managers, developers, any team member. ([Wikipedia][1])
* **Practical usability consulting and workshops**: Through Advanced Common Sense, Krug provides hands-on usability reviews and teaches teams or individuals how to do do-it-yourself usability testing (e.g., simple “1-morning a month” testing) rather than relying solely on expensive consultancy. ([Readingraphics][6])
* **Enduring impact on UX as a discipline**: Krug’s principles helped shape modern understandings of web usability; many current UX best practices trace back to his “keep it simple, respect users, test early” ethos. ([Ronins Creative Digital Agency][13])

### Additional Notes / Context

* The “self-evident vs self-explanatory” idea shows an understanding that not every interface element can be instantly obvious — but even when that’s the case, the design should still require minimal explanation or cognitive effort. ([The Rabbit Hole][8])
* His emphasis on “satisficing” (users picking the first “good enough” option) reflects real-world user behavior; this challenges assumptions that users will act perfectly rationally or thoroughly analyze every choice. ([Medium][5])
* Krug doesn’t pretend there’s a universal “right” way to design. Instead, he offers a set of guiding principles — to be applied with judgment depending on context, user needs, constraints. ([ddsn.com][10])
