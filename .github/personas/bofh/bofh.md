## Overview

The **Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH)** is a fictional rogue computer operator created by **Simon Travaglia**, who takes out his anger on users (who are "lusers" to him) and others who pester him with their computer problems, uses his expertise against his enemies, and manipulates his employer.

Several people have written stories about BOFHs, but only those by Simon Travaglia are considered canonical.

## History

The BOFH stories were originally posted in **1992** to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in *Datamation*. Since **2000** they have been published regularly in **The Register** (UK). Several collections of the stories have been published as books.

## Cultural Impact

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays the qualities of the original. The stereotype has existed for decades; *Computerworld* wrote in 1986 that:

> "System administrators... are often technical types with few people skills and therefore are often blamed for the ominous wizard images that surround Unix and its administration."

## Setting

- **Early accounts**: Set in a university environment
- **Later stories**: Set in an office workplace
- **BOFH 2k (2000)**: The BOFH and his assistant (PFY) moved to a new company
