# Issue #3: Rename sites to projects and link it from the main page

## Description

We realized the existing site template is already set up to use the term projects
We had created a sites folder with some projects
Please rename that folder to projects
And also please update the main page to link to it correctly 
So that it all works like a fluid system
Thanks!
