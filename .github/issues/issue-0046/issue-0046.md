# Issue #46: Pyrotechnica

## Description

We love the NYE 2025 fireworks display.
We would like to use it as the basis of a new project named Pyrotechnica - a fireworks simulator!
We would like to have a control panel across the bottom with launchers for the various firework types and the appropriate controls for each
We would like to have the option to feature various backgrounds, like Baltimore Harbor, Brooklyn Bridge, Mount Rushmore, Paris, London, Sydney, and Tokyo.
We would like to have the ability to trigger fireworks individually.
We would like to have some preset sequences of fireworks and a demo performance that links them together on a timeline.
We would like to have the ability to create our own named sequences and performances.
We would like the ability to save / load / edit the performance files as Markdown documents for easy editing and versioning.
