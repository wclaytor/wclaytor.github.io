We would like to add a headshot to our about page. Please use the frontend-design skill and any other relevant skills to create an updated design for the section that includes the provided headshot. The design should be consistent with the current site guidelines, but not only include the photo but look like the person that it is describing, if that makes sense. This section should convey the person through the image, the writing, the layout, the color choices, etc...
