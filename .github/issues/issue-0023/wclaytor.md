We would like to add a headshot to our about page. Please use the frontend-design skill and any other relevant skills to create an updated design for the section that includes the provided headshot. The design should be consistent with the current site guidelines, but not only include the photo but look like the person that it is describing, if that makes sense. This section should convey the person through the image, the writing, the layout, the color choices, etc...

That is very nice! Please get rid of the em dashes.

Ok, let us talk about that content:

```
A methodical problem-solver who believes that quality is everyone's responsibility, and that the best software is built when we bake testing in from the start, not bolt it on at the end.

With over 25 years of hands-on experience spanning software development, quality assurance, and test automation, I've had the privilege of building teams, shipping products, and transforming how organizations think about quality.

Currently pioneering AI-assisted QA workflows, using tools like GitHub Copilot and automated pipelines to turn what used to take hours into minutes.

We are working on the about section.

We have the current intro text:

```

```

That last bit sounds negative. We could just chop it off to read:
```
A methodical problem-solver who believes that quality is everyone's responsibility, and that the best software is built when we bake QA in from the start.
```

That feels solid. But we lose that nuance, which actually seems more like a dig. Shall we just smile and ignore it, try to spin it in a positive way, or call out that bullshit?
