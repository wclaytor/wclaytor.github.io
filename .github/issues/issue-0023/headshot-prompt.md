# headshots

We are working on our linked in profile. We need a good updated headshot photo. Unfortunately we don't currently have access to a camera. Therefore, we need to work with existing candid photos from a variety of contexts over the last several years and then create a virtual updated headshot.

We did some research on the topic and found an example where a user provided a single image and got a great result with the following prompt:

```
Edit this image. I need a professional, high-resolution, profile photo, maintaining the exact facial structure, identity, and key features of the person in the input image. The subject is framed from the chest up, with ample headroom and negative space above their head, ensuring the top of their head is not cropped. The person looks directly at the camera with a confident, authoritative expression, and the subject's body is positioned at a slight 3/4 angle to the camera. They are styled for a professional photo studio shoot, wearing a premium navy business suit with a crisp white dress shirt and understated tie. The background is a solid '#141414' neutral studio. Shot from a high angle with bright and airy soft, diffused studio lighting, gently illuminating the face and creating a subtle catchlight in the eyes, conveying a sense of authority and leadership. Captured on an 85mm f/1.8 lens with a shallow depth of field, exquisite focus on the eyes, and beautiful, soft bokeh. Observe crisp detail on the fabric texture of the suit, individual strands of hair, and natural, realistic skin texture. The atmosphere exudes confidence, professionalism, and executive presence. Clean and bright cinematic color grading with subtle warmth and balanced tones, ensuring a polished and contemporary feel.

However, in this user's case they had a good starter photo. In our case we have four older photos with good facial detail, but in those we were clean shaven and had shorter hair. And we have one recent photo where we now have long hair pulled back in a ponytail, and neatly trimmed mustache, goatee, and sideburns.

Please create our updated headshot using the details provided in the example prompt but using our photos.
