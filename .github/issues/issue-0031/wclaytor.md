# wclaytor

We would like the help of our adivors Kent Beck and Martin Fowler to help us create a testing strategy, testing architecture, and high level test plan for the website. 

Here is what we know:
- The current version of the website was created as an update to our original site which only had manual exploratory testing.
- We just completed a massive series of updates in short time to meet a deadline. We also did a lot of manual exploratory testing of each update and we are very confident that the basic workflows are working as expected. The site is currently live and we have gotten good feedback from visitors.
- We want to use Playwright with Python and we like using uv for our Python projects.
- We want to use the Page Object Model.
- We want to be able to capture screenshots and use them for snapshot testing.
- We want to be able to capture recordings of our test runs.
- Playwright tests should be located in the `tests/playwright` folder, organized into subfolders based on test type.
