# PR #4: Rename sites folder to projects and link it from the main page

**Status**: `MERGED` ✅ | **Branch**: `copilot/rename-sites-to-projects` → `main`

**Changes**: +4 -4 across 25 files

## Description

## Overview
This PR renames the `sites` folder to `projects` to align with the site template's existing "Projects" terminology in the navigation. It also fixes the main page navigation by linking the Projects menu item to the actual projects showcase page instead of a non-existent anchor.

## Problem
The site had an inconsistency where:
- The navigation menu referenced "Projects" but linked to `#projects` (a non-existent anchor on the main page)
- The actual projects were stored in a folder called `sites/` 
- The showcase page header said "Sites" instead of "Projects"

This created a confusing and non-functional navigation experience.

## Solution
1. **Renamed directory structure**: Changed `sites/` to `projects/` using `git mv` to preserve git history
2. **Updated projects showcase page** (`projects/index.html`):
   - Changed page title from "Sites Showcase" to "Projects Showcase"
   - Updated main header from "Sites" to "Projects"
   - Updated HTML comments for consistency
3. **Fixed main page navigation** (`index.html`):
   - Changed Projects link from `href="#projects"` to `href="projects/index.html"`

## Result
The site now has a cohesive, functional navigation system where:
- Clicking "Projects" in the main menu navigates to the projects showcase page
- All terminology is consistent ("Projects" throughout)
- All internal links to individual projects (Alpine Waves, Ambient Beat Nexus, Alpine Algorithmic Art) work correctly

## Screenshots

**Main Page with updated Projects navigation:**

**Projects Showcase Page (renamed from "Sites"):**
![Projects Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3100542b-d52b-4d38-a010-b5d6898e0728)

The navigation flow is now fluid and intuitive, matching the template's intended design.
