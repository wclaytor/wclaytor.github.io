# PR #30: Add skill-professor: automated skill tutorial generation

**Status**: `MERGED` ✅ | **Branch**: `copilot/create-skill-professor-skill` → `main`

**Changes**: +1395 -0 across 14 files

## Description

Creates `skill-professor`, a meta-skill that generates comprehensive, hands-on tutorials for any skill in the library. Takes a skill specification and produces structured learning experiences that guide users from understanding to working implementation in their own projects.

## Implementation

- **`.claude/skills/skill-professor/SKILL.md`** (187 lines)
  - 5-phase workflow: Analyze target skill → Understand user context → Design structure → Deliver tutorial → Verify mastery
  - Tutorial types: Quick (15-20min), Standard (30-45min), Comprehensive (60min+)
  - Adaptation patterns for technical, creative, workflow, and integration skills
  - Anti-patterns and pedagogical guidelines

- **`references/tutorial-patterns.md`** (178 lines)
  - Progressive complexity framework
  - Scaffolding techniques and checkpoint patterns
  - Success criteria and common pitfalls

## Usage

```markdown
User: "Teach me the canvas-design skill"
→ Analyzes canvas-design/SKILL.md
→ Determines user's project context
→ Delivers creative tutorial emphasizing exploration
→ User completes with working canvas implementation

User: "I need to learn pdf processing"
→ Identifies pdf skill
→ Creates technical tutorial with code examples
→ Guides through real document processing task
```

Follows skill-creator guidelines: concise description (231 chars), progressive disclosure, workflow-based structure.
