## ✨ About Section Redesign Complete

This PR adds the professional headshot to the About section with a completely redesigned layout that conveys the person through visual design choices.

### Changes Made

**📸 Headshot Integration**
- Professional headshot prominently featured with elegant framing
- Subtle hover effects and teal accent lines
- Responsive sizing across all breakpoints

**🎨 Design Philosophy**
The color palette was intentionally chosen to reflect the photo:
- **Navy blue gradient** background echoes the suit
- **Teal accents** (`#64a19d`) complement the blue tie
- **Sophisticated dark tones** convey professionalism and experience

**📝 Updated Content**
- Humanized, first-person copy with authentic voice
- Philosophy statement: *"quality is everyone's responsibility"*
- Highlights 25+ years experience and current AI-assisted QA work

**🃏 New Expertise Cards**
Three beautifully styled cards showcasing:
1. **Software Development** - Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, JavaScript
2. **Quality Assurance** - Team Leadership, CI/CD, SDLC
3. **Test Automation** - Selenium, Playwright, Gatling, API Testing

**♿ Accessibility**
- WCAG-compliant contrast ratios
- Descriptive alt text on headshot
- Keyboard-accessible interactions
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Files Modified
- `index.html` - Restructured About section HTML
- `css/styles.css` - Added ~300 lines of new styling for the About section

### Preview
The headshot with dark background (`headshot-dark.jpg`) works perfectly with the site's dark theme aesthetic.

## About Section Intro Text Updated

Simplified the intro text to be more professional and positive:

**Before:**
> A methodical problem-solver who believes that quality is everyone's responsibility, and that the best software is built when we bake QA in from the start, not try to bolt it on at the end.

**After:**
> A methodical problem-solver who believes that quality is everyone's responsibility, and that the best software is built when we bake QA in from the start.

Removed the "not try to bolt it on at the end" phrase to keep the messaging clean and confident without any potentially negative undertones.

## 🎨 Theme-Aware Headshots Added to Dynamic Resume

Added theme-switching headshots to the Dynamic Resume (v2.4) that swap based on light/dark theme:

**Features:**
- Light theme → Light background headshot (gray suit)
- Dark theme → Dark background headshot (navy suit)
- Smooth 0.3s transition when toggling themes
- Respects system `prefers-color-scheme` preference
- Responsive sizing (100px desktop, 80px mobile)
- Circular frame with border and shadow matching card style

**Files Changed:**
- `projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.4/william_claytor_resume.html`

This establishes the pattern for theme-aware headshots that can be cycled back into the resume generator script and template. Epic! 🚀

## 📐 Headshot Shape Comparison: Rectangular

Updated the headshot to rectangular format for comparison:

**Circular (previous):**
- 100x100px, border-radius: 50%
- Modern/social-media style

**Rectangular (current):**
- 90x120px (3:4 portrait aspect ratio)
- border-radius: 12px (subtle rounded corners)
- object-position: center top (keeps face in frame)
- Traditional headshot/ID photo feel

Ready for A/B comparison to decide which style fits better!

## 🐛 Fix: Theme-Aware Headshot Default Behavior

Fixed the headshot theme switching logic to properly default to light:

**Problem:** Dark headshot was showing when system was in light mode (auto theme)

**Solution:** Simplified the CSS cascade:
1. **Default**: Light headshot visible (baseline, no media query needed)
2. **Explicit dark theme**: Dark headshot via `[data-theme="dark"]` selector
3. **Auto mode + system dark**: Dark headshot via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` only when no explicit theme is set

Key insight: Light is the default, so we only need to override to dark when conditions require it. No need to explicitly handle light preference.

## 🔧 Fix: Headshot Image Paths for Live Resume

Fixed the image paths in `assets/resume/william_claytor_resume.html`:

**Problem:** Images not loading due to incorrect relative paths

**Old paths:** `../../../../assets/img/headshot-light.jpg` (wrong - too many levels up)

**New paths:** `../img/headshot-light.jpg` (correct - from `assets/resume/` → `assets/img/`)

Headshots now load correctly on the live resume page! 🎉
