# PR #47: Pyrotechnica

**Status**: `MERGED` ✅ | **Branch**: `46-pyrotechnica` → `main`

**Changes**: +11277 -3 across 30 files

## Description

This pull request introduces the new Pyrotechnica fireworks simulator project, outlining its vision, features, implementation plan, and technical details. It adds comprehensive documentation, planning, and a sample performance script, establishing the foundation for development and collaboration.

**Project Planning and Documentation**

- Added a detailed project plan for Pyrotechnica, specifying modular architecture, UI controls, background management, sequence and performance systems, and Markdown-based persistence. The plan also discusses UI frameworks, image handling, and data storage considerations.
- Created an issue (`issue-0046.md`) describing the Pyrotechnica project goals, user stories, and desired features, serving as the main requirements document.
- Added prompt templates for GitHub issue planning and implementation, to standardize and guide future contributions.

**Feature and Usage Documentation**

- Introduced a comprehensive README for Pyrotechnica, detailing features, controls, data storage, event scripting format, and technical architecture. This serves as both user and developer documentation.
- Added a sample performance script (`midnight-celebration.md`) in Markdown format, demonstrating the event scripting system and providing guidance for users to create and import their own performances.
- Created a separate README for the core engine in `projects/pyrotechnica`, outlining the phased roadmap, feature set, controls, and technical stack.

**Issue Management**

- Closed the previous NYE 2025 issue (`issue-0044.md`), marking it as completed to transition focus to the new Pyrotechnica project.

## 🎆 Pyrotechnica - Step 1 Complete: Core Architecture

### Summary
Implemented the foundational firework engine for Issue #46, transforming the NYE 2025 fireworks into the new **Pyrotechnica** simulator.

### What's Included

**Modular Classes:**
- `Particle` - Individual explosion particles with physics, trails, sparkle effects
- `Rocket` - Rising firework with trail before explosion  
- `FireworkEngine` - Main engine managing particles, rockets, and canvas rendering

**10 Firework Types:**
| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Spherical | Classic round explosion |
| Chrysanthemum | Long-trailing sparkly burst |
| Ring | Uniform circular pattern |
| Willow | Heavy gravity, drooping trails |
| Double Burst | Secondary explosion after initial |
| Crossette | Splitting particles |
| Heart | Heart-shaped pattern |
| Star | 5-point star pattern |
| Spiral | Rotating spiral effect |
| Mega Crackle | Many small sparkly particles |

**11 Color Palettes:** Gold, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Amethyst, Silver, Copper, Pink, Cyan, White, Rainbow

**Controls:**
- Click anywhere to launch fireworks
- Press `Space` for random launch
- Press `1-0` to select firework types

**Tech Stack:**
- Alpine.js for reactive state management
- HTML5 Canvas with requestAnimationFrame
- Custom particle physics (gravity, air resistance, trails)

### Files Changed
- `/projects/pyrotechnica/index.html` - Complete implementation
- `/projects/pyrotechnica/README.md` - Updated documentation

### Roadmap Progress
- [x] Step 1: Core architecture ✅
- [ ] Step 2: Control panel UI
- [ ] Step 3: Background system
- [ ] Step 4: Sequence engine
- [ ] Step 5: Performance timeline
- [ ] Step 6: Markdown persistence

### Next Steps
Ready for **Step 2: Control Panel UI** with launcher buttons, color picker, and position controls.

## 🎆 Pyrotechnica - Development Complete!

### Summary
The Pyrotechnica fireworks simulator has been successfully developed and refined through multiple iterations, transforming the NYE 2025 fireworks display into a professional-grade fireworks design and performance tool.

### Features Implemented

**Core Engine:**
- 10 firework explosion types (Spherical, Chrysanthemum, Ring, Willow, Double Burst, Crossette, Heart, Star, Spiral, Mega Crackle)
- 10 color palettes with beautiful gradients
- Particle physics system with gravity, drag, and trails
- Web Audio API synthesized sound effects
- Screen flash and shake effects (contained to viewport)

**Control Panel UI:**
- Professional collapsible, tabbed interface
- Individual launcher buttons with keyboard shortcuts (1-0)
- Background selector with 8 scenic landmarks
- Sound, confetti, and demo toggles

**Sequence & Performance System:**
- Create and manage custom firework sequences
- Performance timeline editor with visual playback
- Markdown import/export for easy sharing
- localStorage persistence
- Pre-built demo sequences and "New Year Spectacular" performance

**Scenic Backgrounds:**
- Night Sky (animated starfield)
- Custom SVG silhouettes for: Baltimore Harbor, Brooklyn Bridge, Mount Rushmore, Paris (Eiffel Tower), London (Tower Bridge), Sydney Opera House, Tokyo Tower

### Bug Fixes Applied
- ✅ Screen shake now only affects viewport (not header/controls)
- ✅ Flash effect contained to viewport
- ✅ Panel toggle arrows flip correctly
- ✅ Confetti toggle added (C key or header button)
- ✅ Disabled random auto-launching (user controls all)
- ✅ Replaced photo backgrounds with elegant SVG silhouettes

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with usage instructions
- PLAN.md with full roadmap for future phases
- CLAUDE.md for AI assistant context
- ISSUES.md tracking initial bugs (now resolved)
- midnight-celebration.md sample performance file

### Tech Stack
- Zero dependencies - Pure vanilla JavaScript
- Single HTML file architecture for maximum portability
- HTML5 Canvas rendering at 60fps
- Works offline with localStorage
