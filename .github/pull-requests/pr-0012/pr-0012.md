Added `scripts/image/png2jpg.py` to help optimize screenshots for the website.

**Features:**
- Converts PNG screenshots to optimized JPG format
- Customizable quality (default: 85)
- Handles transparency (converts to white background)
- Progressive JPG for better web loading
- Shows file size savings
- **Keeps original PNG by default** for safety

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic conversion
python3 scripts/image/png2jpg.py path/to/screenshot.png

# Custom quality
python3 scripts/image/png2jpg.py screenshot.png --quality 90

# Delete original after conversion
python3 scripts/image/png2jpg.py screenshot.png --delete-png
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancement: About Section Background

Updated the about section to use the same background styling as the masthead section for visual consistency.

**Changes:**
- Applied the masthead background image to the about section
- Added matching gradient overlay (30% → 70% → 100% black)
- Consistent background positioning (centered, cover, scroll)

**Result:**
The about section now has the same beautiful background image with gradient overlay, creating a more cohesive visual experience across the homepage.

## 🎨 Visual Enhancement: Unified Background with Distinct Filters

Extended the background image to all sections with unique filters to create visual distinction while maintaining cohesion.

**Changes:**
- **Projects Section**: Light, bright overlay (85% → 75% → 90% white) for a clean, professional look
- **Contact Section**: Dark overlay with blue tint (70% black → 80% dark blue → 95% black) for a cool, sophisticated feel

**Visual Flow:**
1. **Masthead** - Dark with warm black gradient
2. **About** - Dark with warm black gradient (matching)
3. **Projects** - Light and bright with white overlay (high contrast)
4. **Contact** - Dark with cool blue-tinted gradient (distinct mood)

**Result:**
Each section now has a unique character through filtered overlays while sharing the same background image, creating a unified yet visually interesting experience throughout the homepage.

## 📐 Project Section Layout Improvements

Enhanced the Featured Project Rows with better proportions and spacing for alternating layouts.

**Changes:**
- **Featured Project Row 1** (Alpine Resume): Image left, text right with left border and padding
- **Featured Project Row 2** (Alpine Markdown Presentation): Text left with right border and padding, image right

**Technical Details:**
- Added `.featured-text-right` CSS class for reversed layouts
- Implemented mirrored padding (2rem right instead of left) for balanced spacing
- Added right border accent to match the design aesthetic
- Right-aligned text on larger screens for better visual flow

**Result:**
Both featured project rows now have comfortable, proportional spacing. The text no longer feels cramped against the image, creating a professional alternating pattern that guides the eye naturally through the projects section.
