# PR #9: 8 projects page update

**Status**: `MERGED` ✅ | **Branch**: `8-projects-page-update` → `main`

**Changes**: +1488 -47 across 6 files

## Description

This pull request introduces comprehensive documentation and targeted optimizations to improve the professionalism, maintainability, and performance of the portfolio site. The most significant changes are the addition of detailed guidelines for contributors and agents, and several enhancements to resource loading and theme handling in the `alpine-resume` project.

**Documentation & Guidelines**

* Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with detailed project principles, technical stack, code style, file organization, content management, design guidelines, testing/QA, GitHub Pages specifics, AI collaboration, priorities, and success metrics. This sets clear standards for all contributors and Copilot suggestions.
* Added `AGENTS.md` outlining agent roles (analysis, design, development, content, deployment), workflow, decision frameworks, common tasks, communication guidelines, quality standards, anti-patterns, and resources. This document ensures consistent, high-quality contributions and smooth collaboration.

**Performance & Resource Loading Improvements**

* In `projects/alpine-resume/index.html`, improved resource hints by adding `crossorigin` to `preconnect` links and preloading the critical theme CSS for faster initial paint.
* Optimized loading of external assets: Bootstrap Icons CSS now loads non-blocking with a `media="print"` strategy, and all third-party scripts (Marked.js, DOMPurify, Alpine.js) load with `defer` for better performance and execution order.

**User Experience & Theme Handling**

* Enhanced dark mode support by immediately setting the `dark` class on the root element based on the initial theme, ensuring compatibility with Tailwind CSS and preventing flash of incorrect theme.
* Improved error handling UI by updating the retry button color to match the Tailwind blue palette for consistency with the site's design system.
