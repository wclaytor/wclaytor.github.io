## 🐛 Bug Fix: alpine-markdown-presentation Sample Loading

Fixed an issue where the sample presentation file wouldn't load on GitHub Pages (though it worked in Codespaces).

### Root Cause
Service workers were using incorrect paths:
- ❌ Absolute paths like `/sample-presentation.md` 
- ❌ Wrong filename (`sample-presentation.md` vs `presentation-sample.md`)
- ❌ Wrong HTML reference (`/presentation-viewer.html` vs `./index.html`)

### Changes Made
1. **Updated service workers** (`service-worker.js` and `sw.js`):
   - Changed to relative paths (`./`)
   - Fixed filename to `presentation-sample.md`
   - Updated HTML reference to `./index.html`
   - Bumped cache version to `v1.0.1` to force updates

2. **Improved fetch error handling** in `index.html`:
   - Added HTTP status checking
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Better fallback to inline sample

### Why This Works
✅ Relative paths work correctly on GitHub Pages at `wclaytor.github.io/projects/alpine-markdown-presentation/`
✅ Cache version bump ensures browsers fetch updated service worker
✅ Robust error handling provides fallback if fetch fails

The presentation now loads the sample file correctly on GitHub Pages! 🎉

## ✅ Resume Script Issue Resolved

**Problem:** The  script was generating HTML files that didn't properly render the UI features (navigation, search, theme toggle, etc.), even though it appeared to embed the resume data.

**Root Cause:** The default CONFIG object in the Python script was minimal and missing essential configuration fields required by the JavaScript template to enable UI features.

**What Was Missing:**
The original config had only:
- Basic UI settings (defaultView, sidebarTitle)
- Minimal shortView settings
- A single companyDescriptions setting

**What Was Needed:**
- Full UI feature flags (enableNav, enableSearch, enableThemeToggle, etc.)
- Complete shortView configuration with sections, earlierExperience
- Search configuration (minQueryLength, highlightMatches, fields)
- Accessibility settings (reduceMotionRespectsPreference, focusVisible, skipLink)
- Metadata fields

**The Fix:** Updated the default CONFIG in `build_resume.py` (lines 289-354) to include the complete configuration structure that matches the impressive `resume-generated-v2.html` example.

**Result:** The script now generates fully-functional resume HTML files with all UI features working correctly! ��

The generated output now matches the reference implementation, with only content-based differences (from the markdown source) remaining.

## ✅ Navigation Update - Home Button Moved to Nav List

**Issue Fixed:** The 'Home' button was previously a separate button in the toolbar. It has now been moved to be the first item in the navigation list.

**Changes Made to v2.3 Template:**

1. **Removed separate Home button** from desktop toolbar
2. **Removed separate Home button** from mobile toolbar
3. **Added Home link** as the first item in the navigation list (desktop)
4. **Added Home link** as the first item in the mobile drawer navigation

**Navigation Structure Now:**
- **Home** (scrolls to top)
- Links
- Summary
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills

**How It Works:**
- The Home link calls `scrollHome()` when clicked, scrolling to the top of the page
- Maintains consistent navigation pattern with other section links
- Works on both desktop and mobile views

The generated HTML now displays navigation as requested: Home appears as the first option in the section list rather than as a separate button.

**Test:** `python projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/build_resume.py projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/william-claytor-resume.md projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/test.html`

## ✅ Navigation Cleanup - Section Type Labels Removed

**Issue Fixed:** Navigation links no longer display redundant section type labels like 'text', 'links', etc.

**Changes Made to v2.3 Template:**

1. **Removed pill labels** from desktop navigation links
2. **Removed pill labels** from mobile navigation links

**Before:**
- Home
- Links **text**
- Summary **text**
- Work Experience **text**
- Education **text**
- Skills **text**

**After:**
- Home
- Links
- Summary
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills

**Implementation:**
Removed `<span class="pill">${sec.kind||''}</span>` from both desktop and mobile navigation rendering code. The navigation now shows clean section titles without type indicators.

**Result:** Cleaner, more professional navigation that focuses on content structure rather than implementation details.

**Test:** `python projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/build_resume.py projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/william-claytor-resume.md projects/dynamic-resume/releases/v2.3/test.html`
