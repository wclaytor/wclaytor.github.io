## Description

## Overview
This PR addresses the user story: "As a user, when I visit the wclaytor.github.io/sites folder, I want a showcase landing page that lets me see what sites are available to check out."

## Changes Made
Created a new landing page at `/sites/index.html` that serves as a showcase for all available web projects and experiments in the repository.

- **Project Cards**: Three featured projects, each with:
  - Descriptive title and overview
  - Gradient background matching each site's visual theme
  - "Visit Site" button for easy navigation
- **Consistent Design**: Maintains the same Bootstrap/Grayscale theme used across the main site
- **Navigation**: Working links to return to the home page and navigate between sections
- **Contact Section**: Consistent footer with email and social media links

## Projects Showcased
1. **Alpine Waves** - Interactive wave generator built with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS
2. **Ambient Beat Nexus** - Immersive algorithmic art and ambient texture generator with Three.js visualizations
3. **Alpine Algorithmic Art** - Creative coding platform using Alpine.js and p5.js
