**Changes**: +1042 -45 across 15 files

## Description


This pull request introduces a comprehensive overhaul and major enhancements to the New Year’s fireworks experience, focusing on next-level interactive features and robust performance optimizations. It also expands the test strategy for the site by adding a new smoke test epic and child issues that define critical automated checks for site health and navigation. Additionally, several issues are closed or updated to reflect completed work and new planning.

### Fireworks Experience Enhancements

* Expanded feature set in `projects/nye-2025/README.md` to include sound effects, screen flash, screen shake, grand finale mode, special shape explosions (hearts, stars, smiley faces, spirals), crackle effects, and color wave mode. New controls for toggling sound and triggering the finale are documented.

* Detailed implementation plan for the ultimate fireworks experience added, outlining technical approaches for each new feature and performance consideration.

### Performance Optimizations

* Added a new section in `projects/nye-2025/README.md` documenting memory management strategies (object caps, pre-allocated buffers, color caching), rendering optimizations (canvas context, cached gradients, simplified particle rendering), early culling, and reduced particle counts to ensure smooth 60fps performance.
* Updated statistics to reflect increased codebase size, optimized particle and object limits, and new sound effects.

### Testing Strategy Expansion

* Introduced a new epic issue `.github/issues/issue-0035/issue-0035.md` for smoke tests, outlining scope, success criteria, and child issues for critical site health checks.
* Added six child smoke test issues for homepage, projects, resume, navigation, console errors, and featured projects accessibility, each with detailed acceptance criteria and technical notes.
