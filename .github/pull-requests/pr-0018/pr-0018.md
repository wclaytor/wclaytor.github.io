# PR #18: 17 site tweaks and polish

**Status**: `MERGED` ✅ | **Branch**: `17-site-tweaks-and-polish` → `main`

**Changes**: +366 -84 across 5 files

## Description

This pull request updates the about section with a new midnight blue theme.

This pull request also updates the visual design of the `contact-section` and the overall `body` background in `css/styles.css`. The main focus is on enhancing the contact section with a layered, blurred background and a subtle grain overlay for a more modern and visually appealing effect, while also refining the body background gradient.

**Visual Design Improvements:**

* Updated the `body` background gradient to use darker, cooler tones for a more modern look.

**Contact Section Redesign:**

* Removed the old `.contact-section` background styling to make way for a new layered effect.
* Added a new blurred background to `.contact-section` using a `::before` pseudo-element with an updated gradient and background image, plus a grain overlay effect via a `::after` pseudo-element for subtle texture.
* Ensured `.contact-section > .container` content appears above the new background effects by adjusting its stacking context.

## Background Theming Adjustments

Applied final polish to the website background theming system:

### About Section
- Updated gradient to use **midnight blue** tones for a sophisticated night-sky atmosphere
- Colors: Dark midnight blue → deeper navy → black
- Maintains seamless visual flow from the masthead

### Contact Section  
- Added **blur effect** (3px with scale compensation) for a premium, dreamy quality
- Implemented **film grain overlay** using SVG noise pattern (8% opacity) for cinematic texture
- Applied unique **indigo-purple gradient** to differentiate from About section while maintaining cohesion
- Gradient: Deep indigo-blue → subtle purple → dark blue → black
- Properly layered using pseudo-elements with correct z-indexing

### Technical Details
- Consolidated duplicate CSS rules
- Used `::before` pseudo-element for blurred background layer
- Used `::after` pseudo-element for grain overlay
- Content container positioned at z-index: 1 to ensure readability

All sections maintain the unified background image approach with different gradient filters for visual variety.

  - Diagonal sweep at 135°
- **Contact Section**: Now features blur + grain effects
  - Indigo-purple gradient at 160°
  - Blur: 3px with scale compensation
  - Film grain: 8% opacity overlay

### New Features ✨

- **Film Grain Toggle**: Cinematic texture overlay (2-20% intensity)
- Real-time preview of blur and grain effects
- Effects included in generated CSS output

### Technical Implementation

The tool now demonstrates the complete theming system including the premium effects used in the Contact section.
